# Game of Set
## This was the final project for the CSC110 class taken at the University of Rhode Island. 

## Objective:
Make a set consisting of three cards where **each** feature is either the **same** on **each** card _**OR**_ is **different** on **each** card. 

### Game Rules:
1. You are randomly dealt twelve cards from a deck of 81 different possibilities of cards.   
2. Each card has four of the following features:  
   - **Number**: one(1), two(2), or three(3) symbols  
   - **Color**: red(R), green(G), or purple(P)  
   - **Shading**: solid(S), outlined(O), or striped(P)  
   - **Shapes**: ovals(O), squiggles(S), or diamonds(D)  

   **For example**:  
     1ROD – 1 red outlined diamond  
     2GPO – 2 green striped ovals  
     3PPS – 3 purple striped squiggles  

3. Identify three cards that would be considered a set (**Each** feature on **each** card having the **same** _OR_ **different** features).
The example above is _**not**_ considered a set because although all the cards have different numbers, colors, and shapes, **however**, two of the cards are _striped_.
4. If you successfully find a set, you may continue to keep looking for another set among the same twelve cards or get dealt another set of cards. If you fail to find a set, you may try again or get dealt another set of cards.
5. Have fun and enjoy!

### Controls:
